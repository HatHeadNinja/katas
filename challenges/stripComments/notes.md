# Summary
A few thoughts on this kata

## Requirements
* provided written requirements quality was low.
* trimming of whitespace only visible in tests

## Tests
* seemed like only one test in the provided test suite
* I wrote a bunch of progressively more complex tests however my first passing code failed the corresponding test in my own test suite
* Going with the successful code as I understand the logic and provided requirements are vauge

## Solution
* wasn't sure if the best solution was to parse an array or a string, either with string or regex. Instinct is to start with regex, as it is the most terse approach, but am not fluent enough
* good examples of other, more terse solutions - will review and refactor my own
