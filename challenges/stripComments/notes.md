# Summary
A few thoughts on this kata

## Requirements
* provided written requirements quality was low
* trimming of whitespace only visible in provided example tests

## Tests
* seemed like only one test in the provided test suite
* wrote a bunch of progressively more complex tests however my first passing code failed the corresponding test in my own test suite
* not going to reconcile difference in tests and going with the successful code anyway as I understand the logic and provided requirements are vague (AKA want to move on!)

## Solution
* wasn't sure if the best solution was to parse an array or a string, either via string or regex. Instinct was to start with regex, as it is the most terse approach, but am not fluent enough
* once solved, site provided examples of other, more terse solutions - will review and refactor my own

## To Do
[] review other solutions and refactor for terseness
